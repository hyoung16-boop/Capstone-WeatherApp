D:\save2\1\weatherapp\app\lint-baseline.xml: Information: 2 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: ObsoleteLintCustomCheck (2) [LintBaseline]

Lint found an issue registry (androidx.compose.runtime.lint.RuntimeIssueRegistry)

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

D:\save2\1\weatherapp\gradle\libs.versions.toml:20: Warning: A newer version of androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx than 2.9.0 is available: 2.11.0 [GradleDependency]
work = "2.9.0"
       ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.
