C:\save\cj\weatherapp\app\build.gradle.kts:14: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

C:\save\cj\weatherapp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:11: Warning: Attribute dataExtractionRules is only used in API level 31 and higher (current min is 30) [UnusedAttribute]
        android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

C:\save\cj\weatherapp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:21: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

             ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\save\cj\weatherapp\app\src\main\java\com\example\weatherproject\util\NotificationHelper.kt:21: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 30 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

    <color name="white">#FFFFFFFF</color>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

C:\save\cj\weatherapp\app\build.gradle.kts:48: Warning: Use version catalog instead [UseTomlInstead]
    implementation("io.coil-kt:coil-compose:2.2.2")
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).
